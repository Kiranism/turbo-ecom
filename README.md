# Turbo Ecom ðŸš€ 

A modern eCommerce application built with Next.js, Prisma, Turborepo, and Shadcn.

## Goal ðŸŽ¯

The goal of this repository is to learn and demonstrate how to structure a monorepo and share packages across multiple apps. This includes:

- **UI Design System**: Utilizing Shadcn UI to create a shared design system used across both admin and user applications.
- **Common Prisma Schema**: Sharing a common Prisma schema across apps to handle database interactions, including the use of server actions for both the admin and user apps.

By organizing the project in a monorepo structure, we can efficiently manage and scale multiple applications with shared components, database models, and logic.
